# Summary statistics and data from the following studies were used in our work
 We used data from individuals of European ancestry only. All data sets were analyzed in genome build hg19. 

Smoking initiation, heaviness, cessation

# Scripts are in a separate branches

'Overlapping' scripts are those related to analyses of data sets with overlapping sample populations (i.e., smoking traits, Yengo et al BMI, Majahan et al T2D, Van der Harst & Verweij CAD all analyzed samples from UKBB)

'Nonoverlapping' scripts are those related to analyses of data sets with non-overlapping sample populations (i.e., Locke et al BMI, Scott et al T2D, Nikpay et al CAD did not use UKBB samples)
